        <p class="content-box">When Woolf is finally able to tear herself away from the rubbish heap of old letters and diaries, it is to read poetry, and, again invoking the writerly reader, she says, “the time to read poetry is when we are almost able to write it.” (Elsewhere, in her diary, she inverts this statement to similar ends: “The most successful reading leaves me with the impulse to write it all over again,” which reminds me again of Barthes. In another beautiful passage in The Pleasure of the Text, he says that his best ideas come to him in a sideways manner while in the presence of someone he loves, and that his most creative reading is oblique or distracted, when he is led to “look up often, to listen to something else.” One could argue this is a doubtful sort of reading since the reader perhaps failed to connect with the writer. On the other hand, how can we object to a reading that is so generative, so capable of spawning the seeds of future texts? I might add, this oblique mode of reading is often how I read Barthes himself, with a sort of free-floating attentiveness to the page and a diffusion of consciousness that tends to set me thinking about my own work and ideas as much as his.)
